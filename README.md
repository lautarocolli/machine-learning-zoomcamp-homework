# Machine Learning Zoomcamp Homework
Repository for submitting ML Zoomcamp homework and classwork.

All homework should be placed in a notebook named `homework` in each module folder.

Coursework filenames are prefixed with the session number (e.g., `07-numpy` in the folder `01-intro` corresponds to class 1.7).
